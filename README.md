# Zelda-RPG-Engine

Work in progress!!

- loads maps generated with tiled
- uses openGL / glfw, rapidjson, stb_image
- draws background using a single quad for each tile layer, generates texture from tilemap on loading of area
- implements a camera clamped to the map (so edges where background ends are never visible
- plan to integrate lua scripting for enemy behavior and cutscenes / dialogue
