# Zelda-RPG-Engine

A work in progress!

game engine for 2d top down games written in c++
- uses openGL for rendering, GLFW for windowing and input
- other libraries used: rapidjson, stb_image and freetype
- loads json maps generated by tiled level editor
- embeds lua using the standard lua C API
- all gameplay code written in lua - see scripts file and GameObject.cpp for lua wrapped functions
- main loop, level loading, rendering, collision detection, creating and destroying game objects happens in C++
- features different rendering for UI overlay, including text rendering using freetype
- classic RPG message box system

To Do:
