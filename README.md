# Zelda-RPG-Engine

A work in progress!

game engine for 2d top down games written in c++
- uses openGL for rendering, GLFW for windowing and input
- other libraries used: rapidjson, stb_image and freetype
- loads json maps generated by tiled, will ultimately include lua scripting

features a ui overlay with text rendering from .ttf fonts, a camera able to be clamped to the map with variable zoom and a dialogue box system allowing any length of string to be split up into a series of message boxes of any shape and size (and any text size).
